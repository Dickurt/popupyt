# YouTube Popup

A Chrome extension that turns the current YouTube video (page) into an embedded window that you can play in the corner of your screen.

## Features

* If the current page is a YouTube page (url: `https://www.youtube.com/watch`), the url will be changed to an embed url (`https://www.youtube.com/embed`).
* If the current page is an embedded YouTube video (url: `https://www.youtube.com/embed`), the url will be changed to a regular YouTube page url (`https://www.youtube.com/watch`).
* If the current page is not any of the above, nothing happens. Magical!
