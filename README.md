# YouTube Popup

A Chrome extension that turns the current YouTube video (page) into an embedded window that you can play in the corner of your screen.

## Features

* If the current page is a YouTube page (url: 'https://www.youtube.com/watch'), the url will be changed to an embed url ('https://www.youtube.com/embed').
* If the current page is an embedded YouTube video (url: 'https://www.youtube.com/embed'), the url will be changed to a regular YouTube page url ('https://www.youtube.com/watch').
* If the current page is not any of the above, nothing happens. Magical!
